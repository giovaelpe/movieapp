# Movieapp
This is a React app that I made just to practice, it is fully responsive

## Features
1. You can search a movie by just typing the title in the searchbar, it fetches data from [OMDBapi](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
2. You can create a favorite movie list and a favorite actor list by clicking the **+** button
3. You can eliminate items from the lists by clicking the **-** button
4. Unfortunately there is no way to save the lists

### Purpose of this app
 I just did it for fun, to practice my react knowlege, and maybe add it to my portfolio
